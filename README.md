Raw slides can be found in the /slides folder of this repository. However, knitting them can be a bit tricky
as several advanced examples requiring local servers are needed in order to display all slides correctly. Hence, the above rendered version allow you to browse the slides w/o creating them locally. 

**Note**: Code examples can be found in /demos. 


## schedule

bi-weekly: 25.9, 9.10. 23.10, 6.11, 20.11, 4.12, 18.12

### 6.11.: Modelling Data Generated by Texts

After we learned how to turn text into data in the last session, we look into more modelling data generated from text. We will explore techniques to such as topic modelling and other text classification strategies. 


### 23.10.: Turning Text into Data

First, we intend to look at how to read in data from files and APIs. But most importantly we will develop basic strategies for exploratory data analysis. The start of this session will **build on your preparation** between sessions 2 and 3!

This session continues to work on R basics and handling data using the R Language. Yet the focus will shift away from 
sourcing pre-processed data to own data generating processes. Since text is a very important source for historians, we 
will look into techniques that were designed to turn text into data. 


### 9.10.: Breaking down R Code | Exploring data /w R

This session teaches R basics in an 'eat-cake-first' approach. That is, we take a relatively complex R function from session 1 and break it down line-by-line, learning the basics along the way. Learn about object creation, basic data types, indexing, scoping and applying functions over lists all while going through to a useful piece of code as opposed to Mickey Mouse examples that were designed to start with the building blocks.



### 25.9.: Inspiration, Motivation and Setup

What can Historians do /w the help of programming? Which questions can be tapped by novice hackers? 
Plus: Getting to know the environment you will work in: R, R Studio, data sources, ... 
Don't forget to tell us about what you are interested in, e.g., specific data sources / problems you may face in your thesis.
