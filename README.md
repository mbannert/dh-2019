Raw slides can be found in the /slides subfolder of each session. However, knitting them can be a bit tricky as several advanced examples requiring local servers are needed in order to display all slides correctly. Hence, the above rendered version allow you to browse the slides w/o creating them locally. 

**Note**: Code examples can be found in the demos subfolder of each session. 


## schedule

bi-weekly: 25.9, 9.10. 23.10, 6.11, 20.11, 4.12, 18.12

### 4.12.: RMarkdown and Documents + Non-Programming Digital Tools

The second but last session will give a short introduction to RMarkdown.
RMarkdown is a language that is used to render different types of documents such as .pdf, Microsoft Word or HTML from R Code and markdown. Markdown itself is a simple (markup) language to style and structure text. By combining markdown and R in the same document, tables & figures do not have to be fit into the text. Instead a code snippet creating a table or figure will be executed. 

In addition we will give an overview of useful digital tools that can accessed without programming. 



### 20.11.: Visualization

The last session in November will focus on data visualization and how hacking can be used to create informative and nifty plots. The session will contain a tour through data viz from scatterplots and barcharts to choropleths and animations. In addition to hands-on code examples will try to understand the role conceptionalizing when visualizing data.



### 6.11.: Modelling Data Generated by Texts

After we learned the basics of turning text into data in the last session, we look into more advanced processes to generate data from text.
We will focus on the concept of document feature matrices and the information we can gather from it using text statistics and text based modelling.

### 23.10.: Turning Text into Data

First, we intend to look at how to read in data from files and APIs. But most importantly we will develop basic strategies for exploratory data analysis. The start of this session will **build on your preparation** between sessions 2 and 3!

This session continues to work on R basics and handling data using the R Language. Yet the focus will shift away from 
sourcing pre-processed data to own data generating processes. Since text is a very important source for historians, we 
will look into techniques that were designed to turn text into data. 


### 9.10.: Breaking down R Code | Exploring data /w R

This session teaches R basics in an 'eat-cake-first' approach. That is, we take a relatively complex R function from session 1 and break it down line-by-line, learning the basics along the way. Learn about object creation, basic data types, indexing, scoping and applying functions over lists all while going through to a useful piece of code as opposed to Mickey Mouse examples that were designed to start with the building blocks.



### 25.9.: Inspiration, Motivation and Setup

What can Historians do /w the help of programming? Which questions can be tapped by novice hackers? 
Plus: Getting to know the environment you will work in: R, R Studio, data sources, ... 
Don't forget to tell us about what you are interested in, e.g., specific data sources / problems you may face in your thesis.
