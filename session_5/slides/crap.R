"Not so see an object. But to see it as something round or squared, something textured or smooth. And to translate what they see into a form language."

- Inge Druckrey about teaching to see in an abstract manner.

"D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.

D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data"

- Data Driven Documents Introduction, Mike Bostock.




- High Level vs. Low Level

- Technology:
    - web technology, interactive
- print
- Types of Charts
- when to use what
- What is visualization ?
    - Why do we visualize data? 
    - at which stage in research does it makes sense?

Document Object Model 


-> When do we viz data in research? 
    (at which stage of our process)
-> show the dino (beginning, diagnostics)
-> show some information is beautiful (publication, communication of results)

-> lanes animation



- Potential discussion: dialects, sociolects of graphics

## Implementation in R 

1. Base R
2. Grammar of Graphics
3. Wild Wild West (WWW)


- BaseR -> tstools example
- grammar of graphics (also time series to see the difference)
- basic graphs bar charts
- ggmap choropleth example
- leaflet Swiss thing


- maybe simple introduction to RMarkdown
